# Surf-Up

# Overview of the analysis
We are trying to determine the temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results

- The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degrees F, which is about 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.
- The frequesncy of tempetures recorded in June have more of a bell-shaped, normal distribution which also explains, why it has a small standard deviation. 
- The weather in June and December is about the same. We can also see that December has a higher varience then June, but they have about the same range and average tempature between the both months.

# Summary

Though December tempature seems to vary more then in June and tends to have lower tempatures in June, I feel that Decemeber would still have the right weather for surfing and ice cream. But, to make a more accurate prediction, I would check the weather of both months, caculaute and compare the perciptaion. Someting else I would do is predict the wind speed for surfing, and compare the average knots between both months.
